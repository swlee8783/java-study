Today, serving as President in the 19th presidential term of the Republic of Korea, I take the first step toward a new Korea. My shoulders are now burdened with heavy mandates entrusted to me by the people, and my heart is burning with enthusiasm to create the kind of country that we have never been able to live in before. My head is now filled with blueprints for ushering in a new world characterized by unity and coexistence.";

It is the nation that our young people have longed for so ardently, in spite of many sacrifices and dedicated efforts. To build such a Republic of Korea, I declare before history and the people with a fearful but humble mind that I will faithfully fulfill my responsibilities and missions as President.";

Even with the impeachment and arrest of the sitting President, our people paved a way forward for the Republic of Korea. They never got discouraged but instead turned the crisis into an opportunity, eventually opening the way to a new world today. The greatness of the Republic of Korea is the greatness of the people.";

When preparations are completed, I am going to leave Cheong Wa Dae to usher in an era of the presidential office in Gwanghwamun Square.

As I promised during my campaign, I will tend to the employment issue first. At the same time, I will take the initiative in reforming conglomerates. Under the Moon Jae-in Administration, the cozy relationship between political and business circles will completely disappear.";

        speech += "I will become an honest president who keeps promises. I will meticulously honor the pledges I made during the campaign. Genuine political progress will be possible only when the president takes the initiative in engaging in trustworthy politics. I will not talk big about doing the impossible. I will admit to the wrong I did. I will not cover up unfavorable public opinion with lies.";

I will endeavor to create a world where those who follow common sense will benefit. I will not overlook the pain of our neighbors. I will always be vigilant with a great sense of caring so that there will be no one left behind. I will become a president who comforts people in sorrow.";
